Thesis Repository of GPS and NTP synchronisation

Files with rt in the end use real time processes. Files with memory in the front use direct memory reading and writing for GPIO.
Main final programs used for the tests and which are talked more about in the thesis are memory_send_rt.c for the sending code and memory_receive_rt.c for receiving code.
